# Credit Card Application Data Analysis

## About the Dataset

This project provides an opportunity to analyze and predict credit card application data. The dataset includes various attributes such as income, age, occupation, and previous credit history, which can influence the credit card approval decision.

The objective of this project is to explore the dataset, clean it, and generate necessary features to build machine learning models that can predict the likelihood of credit card approval.

We will utilize different machine learning algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, and evaluate them to determine the best-performing model.

Our goal is to develop a model that demonstrates good performance and accurately predicts real-world credit card approval decisions. Through this project, we aim to understand credit risk and assist credit card companies in decision-making processes.
